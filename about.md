	My name is Emiliano Plaza and this is my webpage for PHYS-S12: Introduction to Digital Fabrication. I became interested in taking this course because of the broad types of tools, machines, and methods that are used in this course to fabricate things. My background in the topic of engineering and computing is not as strong, but I am experienced in 3D design in programs such as SketchUp and Maya. I was born in Mexico and lived there for about 7 years. Then I moved to Houston, Texas and have lived there ever since. I hope this course expands my ability to fabricate things using code, electric components, 3D design, 2D design, and other methods.
