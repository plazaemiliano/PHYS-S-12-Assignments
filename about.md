My name is Emiliano Plaza and this is my webpage for PHYS-S12: Introduction to Digital Fabrication. I became interested in taking this course because of the broad types of tools, machines, and methods that I will be implementing into the final project. My background in the topic of engineering and computing is not as strong, but I am experienced in 3D design in programs such as SketchUp and Maya. I was born in Mexico and lived there for about 7 years. Then I moved to Houston, Texas and have lived there ever since. I am interested in studying Architecture and Structural/Architectural Engineering and I hope to work alongside my dad because he is a protractor.
