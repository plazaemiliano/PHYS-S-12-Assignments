### **Basic Tools, Procedures, and Electronics**

Today we experimented further with the Arduino UNO and the Circuit Board. We learned about the Digital Multimeter and how to accurately measure volts and current throughout a current with resistors, LEDs, and other variables. Another way we used the Multimeter was through the Arduino Program which visually gave numbers or plotted them on a graph while the circuit was on.

So as you can see, when connecting the wire from the A0 port (on the Arduino UNO) to different checkpoints throughout the circuit, it is possible to measure the current strength in those locations. In the beginning, the current is at its highest strength. After the resistor, the current gets weaker for the LED to work better. Lastly, the current gets to 0 because the resistor inside of the LED lowers the current once again.

Our instructor, Robert Hart, also explained the mathematical method of this explanation. This method is known as Ohm's Law. As Robert explained, Ohm's Law is shown as an equation. Amps (I) = Volts (V) / Ohms (R). Or more simply, Electric Current = Voltage / Resistance.
