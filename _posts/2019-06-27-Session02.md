### **Basic Tools, Procedures, and Electronics** _6/27/2019-6/28/2019_

### 6/27/2019

Today we experiented further with the Arduino UNO and the Circuit Board. We learned about the Digital Multimeter and how to accurately measure volts and current throughout a current with resistors, LEDs, and other variables. Another way we used the Multimeter was through the Arduino Program which visually gave numbers or plotted them on a graph while the circuit was on.
