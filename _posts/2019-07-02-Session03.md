  <p>Today, we spent most of the class time experimenting and learning the Fusion 360 program. We learned the basics of 2D design that we could send to a laser cutter or a vinyl cutter. We decided to design a press fit shape as a tutorial. This is what it looked like:</p>

<p>After learning the basics of how to use Fusion 360, our professor, Robert, showed us how to upload a DXF file to the laser cutter's computer. He also demonstrated how to change the origin of the cutting of the cardboard, how to copy and paste many of the same design, and the safety procedures of handling the laser cutter. Lastly, he showed us how the laser cutter cut out the press fit design. This was one of the cutout press fit shapes:</p>

<p>In the second part of class, one of Robert's colleagues showed us many examples of his work with press fit designs. He made 3D designs with the use of triangular and rectangular press fit shapes. These are two of his own 3D designs:</p>

<p>Lastly, I made my own press fit 2D shapes to use as practice for the laser cutter for the 3rd lab day. These are the three shapes that I came up with, and design accordingly:</p>

  <p>In today's lab, we began by reviewing the safety procedures of the laser cutter. Then, we attempted to laser cut my hexagonal press fit shape. After doing so, there was a glitch on the sketch of the shape and the finished product had a cut through the middle. After this, I designed a kit of four different designs. There was a circle, diamond, rectangle, and 1/4 circle press fit shapes.</p>

  <p>After designing these shapes, I went over to the laser cutter and imported the .dxf files into the pc. After doing so, I adjusted the height from the laser nozzle to 6 mm high, and moved the origin point to the top-left of the cardboard base. Then, I began the cutting process. Here is a video of the adjustment process:</p>

<p>Lastly, I took out the cut cardboard and made a cylinder out of the different shapes that I cut out. Here are the photos I took of the cutout designs and the finished product from these designs:</p>

<div id="Lab 3 pt.2 ~7/08~" class="tabcontent">
  <p>In today's lab, we individually improved our laser cutting techniques and Fusion 360 skills. We were assigned to make our own press fit kits to test our design and laser cutting skills. I decided to make something that will hint to my prototype, so I made a box that can be easily taken apart and could hold an Arduino UNO inside. This will help me find a good size for the body of the 2 motor vehicle I will prototype. I decided to design the box with a different press-fit method. I will make the slots for the side panels in the interior of the faces of the four long faces covering the box. Then I made the other two end faces have four arms that will fit in these interior slots and will hod the whole box together.</p>

<p>Below are photos of the finished and assembled press fit box/kit:</p>
