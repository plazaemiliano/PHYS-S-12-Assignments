Today, we spent most of the class time experimenting and learning the Fusion 360 program. We learned the basics of 2D design that we could send to a laser cutter or a vinyl cutter. We decided to design a press fit shape as a tutorial. This is what it looked like:

After learning the basics of how to use Fusion 360, our professor, Robert, showed us how to upload a DXF file to the laser cutter's computer. He also demonstrated how to change the origin of the cutting of the cardboard, how to copy and paste many of the same design, and the safety procedures of handling the laser cutter. Lastly, he showed us how the laser cutter cut out the press fit design. This was one of the cutout press fit shapes:

The second part of class one of Robert's colleagues showed us many examples of his work with press fit designs. He made 3D designs with the use of triangular and rectangular press fit shapes. These are two of his own 3D designs:

Lastly, I made my own press fit 2D shapes to use as practice for the laser cutter for the 3rd lab day. These are the three shapes that I came up with, and design accordingly:
