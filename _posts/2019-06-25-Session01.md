### **Introduction & Documentation** _6/25/2019 - 6/26/2019_

**6/25/2019**

The first day of class our class learned about the safety procedures in the classroom.

- Wash hands after soldering
- Long hair tied up
- Close toed shoes
- Eye protection while using mills and other cutting machines
- And most importantly pick up and clean area after using it

We also learned where all the machines were and what they did.

- Fillament 3D Printers
- Laser Cutter
- Vinyl Cutter
- Soldering Area
- Shop Bot 3D Cutter
- Mills and other cutting machines

Today during lab times I learned about Arduino UNO boards and how to use them with the help of the Arduino Program to make an LED light in a circuit blink or dim at certain timed intervals. I also learned how to read the Arduino UNO and what things were what; Such as the numbers with the ~ symbol next to them mean that they can be used as a fake input for information to send to the LED circuit. This info commanded the LED when to stop blinking, how long to blink, or, when to fade, how long to fade for, and pauses between fading to 0% and 100%.
