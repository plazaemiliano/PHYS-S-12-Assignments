<p>Today during Tuesday's class, we spent the first 30 minutes talking about our own ptorotype progression. Afterwards, we were demonstrated by some of the other professors at Harvard things like 3d kinetic prints, ball joint prints, scanned prints, and other various uses of 3d technology. The two things that impressed me the the most was the accuracy of the 3d scanners and the method of 3d printing that you can print built in gearboxes and joints for different uses. Below are some visual examples of these:</p>

<p>After these demonstrations, I downloaded the Cura 3d printer program and managed to convert my Fusion 360 design to the format that Cura uses. Here is a screenshot of my gearholder design in the Cura program and a video of the STL file:</p>

	<p>During this lab session, our class began the lab by getting familiar with the Prussia 3d printers. We were shown how to upload gcode to the printer to print 15 minute prints. I began by printing a gearholder for the wheels on my prototype and it worked successfuly. Another thing I did was to print the rest of the gear attachments so I can put them on the prototype. Here are pictures of the prints and a timelapse of it:</p>

<p>After finishing up with 3d printing, I updated my press fit kit because it was still too narrow. Upon testing on the other one, the car would keep tilting backwards so I decided to design the whole body a bit wider to disperse the weight. After reassembling the whole presskit I put together the 3d printed parts with the dc motor and it held on pretty well. Here are some pictures of this:</p>
