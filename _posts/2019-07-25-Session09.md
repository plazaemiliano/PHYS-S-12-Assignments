	<h3>Motors</h3>


<h2>Electromagnet Motor</h2>

<p>We were shown a DIY electromagnet motor and we brainstormed how to make the current alternate when the magnets on the spindle rotated. This would attract a magnet and just right when it is about to cross the electromagnet, it would turn negative which would repel the incoming magnet ultimately generating torque and making a motor. One way to detect the magnet getting closer to the elecrtomagnet, is by looking at the voltage that the magnet creates on the coil. Since the magnet generates a little more voltage when passing by the coil, this could trigger the current to change directions creating the motor's alternation of current.</p>


<h2>H Bridge</h2>

<p>This little chip basically is a connection of four switches that open and close in different variations to let a motor go backwards or forwards. This is a very helpful tool if you want a car to go backwards or forwards (I'll need it for my final project).</p>


<h2>Stepper Motors</h2>

<p>These motors are for exact turns of the motor. For example, you can tell it to go 1 full revolution and back 1 full revolution and it does it exactly every single time. These motors are what the ShopBot uses to drive the drillbit precisely and accurately with input code. These motors would be great for helping the mechanism of my final prototype to work. This mechanism is basically a little elevator that carries the main body of the car up/down, and moves the front wheels and back wheels together/apart (this mechanism could help the car carry longer or shorter things from point A to point B). The stepper motor could also make the car get wider with an extra set of wheels pointing sideways and one stepper motor could use a chain to turn two wheels (the ones that go down so the front facing wheels don't get stuck, and the gears that mechanically move the wheel towers apart and close to eachother).</p>


<h2>Servo Motors</h2>

<p>This motora basically gets an input of a certian square wave to read where you want it to move. Structurally, a servo motor is basically a potentiometer hooked up onto a motor which acts sort of like an arm that rotates a specific distance that it reads through code. These motors also have many gears inside which help it have much more torque than a DC motor.</p>
