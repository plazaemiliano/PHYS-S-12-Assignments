	<p>Today's class session began by everyone introducing their finished prototypes to the whole class. After the presenting, we hopped on over tothe Arduino workshop where we learned more about different circuits and different ways to manipulate it. The first workshop we did was an LED that was controlled by the pushing of a button. Here is a video of it in action:</p>

<p>After accomplishing this task of coding and making the circuit for a button controlled dc motor, I decided that a potentiometer would fit my prototype better. I realized over the weekend that using this potentiometer will let me control the speed of the car. I could make it go fast, slow, and stop. Below is a video of the motors working with the potentiometer:</p>

<p>In the lab on Monday the 15th, I created a new main body for the press fit kit because I realized I needed to fit the bread board and other medium sized components inside of the car so it could be managable. I decided to design it much longer and to have bigger pressfit holes to have more friction and ulitmately so the car holds itself together better. Below is a screenshot of the design I came up with & the assembled body kit:</p>

<p>After assembling the new pressfit kit, I noticed how the wheels to the DC motors were not fitting in correctly. I learned that it was because the cardboard had no strength in its hollow core. I decided I had to create a 3D design for the DC motor's gear so I could make it spin cardboard more easily. I made the hole for the DC motor gear teeth to go into and I later designed plates that will be attached with the slots so they can have more surface area covering more carboard for ultimate sturdiness. These plates have small holes for screws to go into one from one side of the cardboard, outside a parallel hole on the other side of the cardboard, and tightened with a mechanical screw nut. Below are screenshots of this design:</p>
