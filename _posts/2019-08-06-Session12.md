### Final Project Ideas

My first idea on the final project prototype would be some sort of four wheeled vehicle that can move in any direction (wheels turn 360 degrees), be able to get wider and elongate, and be able to get taller. The purpose of these abilities will allow the vehicle to overcome any physical obstacles. The vehicle would get taller and wider to go over traffic and it would get wider to pass over things like large potholes or damaged roads. The 360 degree wheel rotation could let the vehicle turn in any direction, move in any direction while facing forwards, and be able to park into any parking spot possible. All of this could be controlled with Bluetooth, WIFI, or direct wire control.
