<h2>Brainstorming</h2>

  <p>My first idea on the final project prototype would be some sort of four wheeled vehicle that can move in any direction (wheels turn 360 degrees), be able to get wider and elongate, and be able to get taller. The purpose of these abilities will allow the vehicle to overcome any physical obstacles. The vehicle would get taller and wider to go over traffic and it would get wider to pass over things like large potholes or damaged roads. The 360 degree wheel rotation could let the vehicle turn in any direction, move in any direction while facing forwards, and be able to park into any parking spot possible. All of this could be controlled with Bluetooth, WIFI, or direct wire control.</p>

<h2>Altering Final Idea</h2>

<p>After finishing up on the required assingment, I needed to make a new press-fit kit for my final prototype. The design would need two separate main boxes for the wheels to be next to. These boxes would be able to be separated to create a widening effect on the car. Also, I designed it to be longer than wider (opposite from first press-fit kit). Here is a screenshot of the final design of the laser cut parts:</p>

<h2>Final Prototype!!!</h2>

<p>As suprising as it may seem, my final prototype was absolutely perfect! It was flawless and it worked perfectly as expected! <â€“ that's what I wish happened but the opposite happened. My final prototype wasn't fully completed by the time I presented it and everything seemed to be failing the closer I got to the deadline. I programmed all of the electronics the night before, but when I assemebled it onto my robot, nothing worked. I had to basically rewire everything and reupload all of the code to the robot in under an hour and of course it didn't fully function properly. The two servo motors kept interrupting eachother and glitching out, the left wheel wasn't responding to the potentiometer controlling it, and the stepper motor wasn't turning whatsoever. Since one of the wheels and one of the servos was working, I decided to perfect the stepper motor. Anyways, below are the pictures of the final robot and videos of the different components (except the one wheel because it was unnecessary to make the car go in circles):</p>
